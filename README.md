[![Build Status](https://github.com/wagenhoffer/fooetal.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/wagenhoffer/fooetal.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

# FooEtal

FooEtal is a software package that implements the complex (yet entirely fictitious) Foo et al. parameterization. This parameterization can take the radius of a sphere and return its volume, surface area, and other properties. The package is designed as a community project, allowing for continuous introduction of new science features over time by multiple contributors.

## Features

- Calculate the volume of a sphere given its radius using the Foo et al. parameterization.
- Calculate the surface area of a sphere given its radius.
- Calculate the volume of a spherical cap given the radius of the sphere and the height of the cap.
- Support for complex radii when calculating the volume of a sphere.
- Integration module for incorporating the Foo parameterization implementation into larger software packages.


### Integration with Other Software

The `FooEtal` package provides an integration module that exposes the core functionality as an API or a library, allowing other software packages to incorporate the Foo parameterization implementation seamlessly. Refer to the documentation for more details on how to integrate the package into your software.

## Expanding the Code

The modular architecture of the `FooEtal` package allows for easy extensibility and integration of new features or modifications introduced by future contributors. Here are some ways to expand the code:

1. **Add New Parameterizations**: Implement additional parameterizations related to spheres, spherical caps, or other geometric shapes by extending the `fooetal` module.

2. **Incorporate Mesh Calculations**: The `Meshing.jl` works seemlessly with the system built. Look to it for inspiration on how to incorportate into yyour ssytem. 

4. **Optimize Performance**: Explore opportunities for performance optimizations, such as parallelization or leveraging hardware acceleration. The use of broadcasting `.` will allow for vectorization of the functions. 

5. **Add New Features**: Introduce new features based on the requirements of the Foo et al. parameterization or the needs of the community, such as support for additional geometric shapes, coordinate transformations, or scientific applications.
